Hello ðŸ‘‹! 

Currently focused on making AIs compete against each other in real physically-simulated sports at Ludus Labs. 

Before this I spent time applying/studying ML models to better understand society and individuals. I was a PhD student (on leave) in CS at Princeton working with Arvind Narayanan, Matt Salganik, and Tom Griffiths supported by the Gordon Wu Fellowship. Prior to coming here I spent a few years working with Robert West and [dlab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL. Additionally, I spent 6 months at the Max Planck Institute in [SaarbrÃ¼cken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheidt_(Saarbr%C3%BCcken)) analyzing internet bytes with Anja Feldmann and Ingmar Weber.
I got my undergrad in Toronto, Canada studying math and international relations. The last two of the years I had the honour of working with Ashton Anderson, Robert Soden, and Robert Bothwell!
