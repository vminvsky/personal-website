Hello ðŸ‘‹! 

I'm interested in applying and studying ML models to better understand society and individuals. 

I am a PhD student in CS at Princeton working with Arvind Narayanan and Matt Salganik supported by the Gordon Wu Fellowship. Prior to coming here I sepnt a few years working with Robert West and [dlab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL. 

Additionally, I spent 6 months at the Max Planck Institute in [SaarbrÃ¼cken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheidt_(Saarbr%C3%BCcken)) analyzing internet bytes with Anja Feldmann and Ingmar Weber.

I got my undergrad in Toronto, Canada studying math and international relations. The last two of the years I had the honour of working with Ashton Anderson, Robert Soden, and Robert Bothwell!
