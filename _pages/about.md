Welcome to my humble (jekyll built) website ðŸ‘‹! 

Interested in research that connects ML methods with society.

Currently a researcher at the Max Planck Institute where I'm analyzing internet bytes with Prof. Anja Feldmann and Prof. Ingmar Weber.

Before moving to [SaarbrÃ¼cken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheidt_(Saarbr%C3%BCcken)) I lived in [Lausanne](https://olympics.com/ioc/history/lausanne) for two years where I worked with Prof. Robert West. 

Prior to that I spent four cold winters in Toronto, Canada studying math and international relations. The last two of the years I had the honour of working with Prof. Ashton Anderson, Prof. Robert Soden, and Prof. Robert Bothwell!
